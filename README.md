📌 Overview
With the rise of AI-generated content, misinformation on social media has become a serious concern. This project aims to detect machine-generated tweets using Deep Learning models and FastText embeddings, providing an effective solution to combat online disinformation.

🚀 Features
AI-Generated Tweet Detection: Identifies deepfake tweets in real time.
FastText Word Embeddings: Captures contextual meaning for better classification.
Deep Learning Models (CNN/LSTM): Ensures accurate text classification.
Automated Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text data efficiently.
Scalable & Efficient: Designed for large-scale analysis of social media data.
⚡ Importance of This Project
Fights Misinformation: Helps detect AI-generated tweets that spread false information.
Enhances Online Security: Prevents deepfake tweets from influencing public opinion.
Supports Social Media Platforms: Provides an additional layer of content verification.
Automates Detection: Reduces human effort in analyzing vast amounts of tweets.
🔍 Existing System
Currently, detecting AI-generated tweets is done through:

Manual Verification: Users or fact-checkers manually review suspicious content.
Basic NLP Techniques: Traditional text classification models lack deep contextual understanding.
Keyword-Based Filtering: Some platforms flag tweets based on specific words, which is ineffective.
❗ Challenges in the Existing System
Time-consuming: Manual verification is slow and inefficient.
Inaccurate: Keyword-based methods can’t detect AI-generated text effectively.
Scalability Issues: Existing methods struggle with large datasets.
🚀 Proposed System
This project introduces a Deep Learning-based detection system that:
✅ Uses FastText embeddings for better text representation.
✅ Employs CNN/LSTM models to classify human vs AI-generated tweets.
✅ Implements automated tweet scanning for real-time detection.
✅ Improves Accuracy over traditional methods with deep contextual understanding.
